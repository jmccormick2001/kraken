This document goes a bit deeper into the postgres Operator
design and explains the concepts fuller.

== Third Party Resources

Kubernetes Third Party Resources are used in the design
of the postgres Operator to define:

 * Cluster - *pgclusters*
 * Backup - *pgbackups*
 * Upgrade - *pgupgrades*
 * Clones - *pgclones*
 * Policy - *pgpolicies*

A PostgreSQL Cluster is made up of multiple Deployments, Services, and Proxies.


== Command Line Interface

The pgo command line interface (CLI) is used by a normal end-user
to create databases or clusters, or make changes to existing databases.

The CLI interacts interacts with the Kubernetes cluster using
the golang Kubernetes client package.

The CLI can create a new cluster by creating
a new ThirdPartyResource instance of type *pgcluster*.

From the CLI, users can view existing clusters that
were deployed using the CLI and Operator.  Objects that were
not created by the Crunchy Operator are now viewable from the CLI.

== Operator Deployment

The postgres Operator runs within a Deployment in the Kubernetes
cluster.  An administrator will deploy the postgres Operator Deployment
using the provided script.  Once installed and running, the Operator
pod will start watching for certain defined events.

The operator watches for create/update/delete actions on
the *pgcluster* third party resources.  When
the CLI creates for example a new *pgcluster* third party
resource, the operator catches that event and creates pods and services
for that new cluster request.

== CLI Design

The CLI uses the cobra package to implement CLI functionality
like help text, config file processing, and command line parsing.

=== Verbs

A user works with the CLI by entering verbs to indicate
what they want to do, as follows:
[source,bash]
----
pgo show cluster all
pgo delete cluster db1 db2 db3
pgo create cluster mycluster
----

In the above example, the *show*, *backup*, *delete*, and *create* verbs are used.  The CLI is case sensitive and supports only lowercase.

=== Object Types

Currently the operator supports object types of *backup*, *upgrade*, and *cluster*.
The object type follows the verb as follows:

[source,bash]
----
pgo show cluster all
pgo delete cluster db1 db2 db3
pgo create cluster mycluster
----

== Debugging

To see if the operator pod is running enter the following:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pod -l 'name=postgres-operator'
----

To verify the operator installed the following ThirdPartyResources:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get thirdpartyresources
----

You should see six Crunchy third party resources deployed -

....
pg-backup.crunchydata.com      A postgres backup ThirdPartyResource       v1
pg-clone.crunchydata.com       A postgres clone ThirdPartyResource        v1
pg-cluster.crunchydata.com     A postgres cluster ThirdPartyResource      v1
pg-policy.crunchydata.com      A postgres policy ThirdPartyResource       v1
pg-policylog.crunchydata.com   A postgres policy log ThirdPartyResource   v1
pg-upgrade.crunchydata.com     A postgres upgrade ThirdPartyResource      v1
....

# Command Line Interface

You can view the  TPR Endpoints as follows:

[source,bash]
----
 curl https//192.168.42.30:8443/apis/crunchydata.com/v1/pgclusters --insecure
----

== Persistent Volumes

Currently the operator does not delete persistent volumes, it will
delete the claims on the volumes.  The cleanup and allocation of
PV (persistent volumes) is up to the administrator and insures that
no data is deleted by the operator.


== PostgreSQL Operator Deployment Strategies


This section describes the various deployment strategies
offered by the operator.  A deployment in this case is
the set of objects created in Kubernetes when a
third party resource of type *pgcluster* is created.
TPRs are created by the pgo client command and acted upon
by the postgres operator.

=== Strategies

To support different types of deployments, the operator supports
multiple strategy implementations.  Currently there is
only a default *cluster* strategy.

In the future, more deployment strategies will be supported
to offer users more customization to what they see deployed
in their Kube cluster.

Being open source, users can also write their own strategy!

=== Specifying a Strategy

In the pgo client configuration file, there is a
*CLUSTER.STRATEGY* setting.  The current value of the
default strategy is *1*.  If you don't set that value, the
default strategy is assumed.  If you set that value to something
not supported, the operator will log an error.

=== Strategy Template Files

Each strategy supplies its set of templates used by the operator
to create new pods, services, etc.

When the operator is deployed, part of the deployment process
is to copy the required strategy templates into a ConfigMap (*operator-conf*)
that gets mounted into */operator-conf* within the operator pod.

The directory structure of the strategy templates is as
follows:
....
├── backup-job.json
├── cluster
│   └── 1
│       ├── cluster-deployment-1.json
│       ├── cluster-replica-deployment-1.json
│       └── cluster-service-1.json
├── pvc.json
....

In this structure, each strategy's templates live in a subdirectory
that matches the strategy identifier.  The default strategy templates
are denoted by the value of *1* in the directory structure above.

If you add another strategy, the file names *must* be unique within
the entire strategy directory.  This is due to the way the templates
are stored within the ConfigMap.


=== Default Cluster Deployment Strategy (1)

Using the default cluster strategy, a *cluster* when created by the operator will create the
following on a Kube cluster:

image::operator-diagram-cluster.png?raw=true[]

The default cluster strategy creates the following:

 * deployment running a Postgres *master* container with replica count of 1
 * service mapped to the *master* Postgres database
 * service mapped to the *replica* Postgres database
 * PVC for the *master* will be created if not specified in configuration, this
   assumes you are using a non-shared volume technology (e.g. Amazon EBS),
   if the CLUSTER.PVC_NAME value is set in your configuration then a
   shared volume technology is assumed (e.g. HostPath or NFS), if a PVC
   is created for the master, the naming convention is *clustername-pvc*
   where clustername is the name of your cluster.

If you want to add a Postgres replica to a cluster, you will
*scale* the cluster, for each *replica-count*, a Deployment
will be created that acts as a Postgres replica.
